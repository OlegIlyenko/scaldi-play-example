## Proof of concept

This fork integrates [Scaldi](http://scaldi.org) with new Play 2.4 dependency injection mechanism.

In order to make experimentation easier I copied all source code from [scaldi-play](https://github.com/scaldi/scaldi-play)
to the `/app` folder and made direct dependency on scaldi **0.5-SNAPSHOT**, which already updated with all required functionality.
